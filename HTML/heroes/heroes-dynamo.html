              Dynamo briefly <b>disappears into the void</b> and then reappears

              <b>reloaded</b> and has a <b>fire rate bonus</b> for the next clip
              (Max 8s). Can be cast with M3 to also bring nearby allies and give
              them half fire rate bonus.

          <h2>Lore</h2>
          <p>
            As a Scientist, Professor Dynamo always had an inquisitive mind. So
            when a rift in space and time opened up in central park he was first
            on the scene to investigate â€“ and while he expected such a majestic
            sight to be life changing, he was thinking more in a metaphorical
            way as opposed to having his body atomized and reduced to a tiny
            dying star. But while his body is gone, his spirit and lust for
            knowledge lives on. A tenured professor at Columbia College, Dynamo
            looks to learn more about his condition while maintaining his class
            load, after all: he has future minds to inspire.
