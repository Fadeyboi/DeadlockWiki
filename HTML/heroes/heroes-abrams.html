          <p>
            Hard hitting, hard headed, and hard drinking; Detective Abrams has
            been a fixture on the New York investigating scene for years. From
            stolen art, to missing persons, to ritual murders; Abrams didn't
            just take any case that came across his desk... he solved them. But
            his days of following cheating spouses came to an end the day he
            opened his office door and found The Tome sitting on his desk. No
            instruction was left for him save for a brief note scrawled in onyx
            blood that read "Don't let them have it". Abrams hasn't figured
            where the thing came from; but seeing as his home has been broken
            into, his office tossed on 3 different occasions, and his car
            firebombed he has a vested interest in figuring out what the hell is
            going on.
