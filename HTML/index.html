          <h2>What is Deadlock?</h2>
          <p>
            <i>Deadlock</i> is an upcoming action game developed and published
            by
            <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/" target="_blank">Valve</a
            >. It combines elements of the hero shooter and MOBA genres.
            <i>Deadlock</i> has been in playtesting since 2023, and players with
            access can invite their friends using Steam's playtesting
            functionality. As of August 2024, it had reached a concurrent player
            count of just above 100,000. Since May 2024, numerous leaks have
            occurred, and a journalist was banned from the matchmaking service
            after writing a preview for the technology site <u>The Verge</u>.
            Valve officially unveiled the game in August 2024.

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>
              Deadlock is a 6v6 MOBA third person shooter. It will be Valve's
              first true third-person shooter, save for the top-down Alien
              Swarm, which was begun by an outside team. Players control
              powerful hero characters and escort NPCs down several "lanes" in
              order to destroy the enemy team's stationary defenses. This makes
              the moment-to-moment gameplay highly similar to MOBAs. If the
              enemy's defenses are destroyed, it reveals their "Patron", a
              tremendous magically animated golem that must be defeated to win
              the match. Players can unlock various skills and abilities for
              their hero, as well as use ziplines to navigate the arena. The
              game currently has 21 different heroes, though it is unclear what,
              if any, lore or backstory about them exists beyond their names and
              descriptions. The game takes place in an alternate version of New
              York City called the Cursed Apple, which mixes elements of 1930s
              Prohibition era storytelling and the occult
